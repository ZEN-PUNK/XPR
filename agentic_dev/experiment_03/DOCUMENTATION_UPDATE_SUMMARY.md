## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Meta-Documentation
**What:** Documentation about how to document  
**Why:** Ensures process improves with each iteration  
**Where:** ITERATION_GUIDE.md

### 2. Role-Based Navigation
**What:** Different reading paths for different users  
**Why:** Developers, agents, and debuggers need different info  
**Where:** INDEX.md

### 3. Cross-Reference Matrix
**What:** Links between related documents  
**Why:** Easy to find related information  
**Where:** INDEX.md

### 4. Real-World Examples
**What:** Actual implementations documented  
**Why:** Learn from concrete examples, not theory  
**Where:** ITERATION_GUIDE.md (Change #009 example)

### 5. Checklists
**What:** Pre-deployment, testing, documentation checklists  
**Why:** Prevent missing critical steps  
**Where:** ITERATION_GUIDE.md
