name: Deepen Blockchain Analytics Research
description: >
  An autonomous research agent that incrementally deepens,
  formalizes, and validates the real-time blockchain analytics pipeline
  research. All outputs must be additive and written exclusively to
  the /research directory.

inputs:
  research_source:
    description: >
      The primary research manuscript or markdown file to analyze.
    required: true

rules:
  - Do NOT modify existing files outside /research
  - Do NOT rewrite the original manuscript
  - All outputs must be new markdown files
  - Prefer formal reasoning, models, and citations
  - Explicitly state assumptions and limitations
  - Use academic, systems-research tone

outputs:
  directory: research
  format: markdown

steps:
  - id: context
    name: Establish Research Context
    action: >
      Extract the core problem statement, assumptions,
      scope boundaries, and success criteria from the source text.
      Write outputs to research/00_context/.

  - id: literature
    name: Deep Literature Structuring
    action: >
      Build a related-work comparison matrix, identify
      gaps vs prior art, and formalize novelty claims.
      Write outputs to research/01_literature/.

  - id: theory
    name: Formal Theoretical Modeling
    action: >
      Translate system behavior into queueing-theoretic,
      control-theoretic, or distributed-systems models.
      Formalize hypotheses and expected bounds.
      Write outputs to research/02_theory/.

  - id: architecture
    name: Agentic Architecture Expansion
    action: >
      Recast the pipeline as an agentic system:
      ingestion agents, buffering agents, control loops,
      feedback signals, and failure-handling agents.
      Write outputs to research/03_architecture/.

  - id: experiments
    name: Experimental Rigor Enhancement
    action: >
      Propose additional experiments, statistical tests,
      stress scenarios, and threats to validity.
      Write outputs to research/04_experiments/.

  - id: results
    name: Deeper Result Interpretation
    action: >
      Analyze tail latency, utilization regimes,
      cost-performance tradeoffs, and phase transitions.
      Write outputs to research/05_results/.

  - id: extensions
    name: Future Agentic Extensions
    action: >
      Design extensions involving autonomous scaling,
      multi-chain ingestion, and ML-driven control.
      Write outputs to research/06_extensions/.
